Now look at the code below and see if you can find the detail that turns a list comprehension into a generator:


the_list = [1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0 for x in range(10)]
the_generator = (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0 for x in range(10))
 
for v in the_list:
    print(v, end=" ")
print()
 
for v in the_generator:
    print(v, end=" ")
print()


It's the parentheses. The brackets make a comprehension, the parentheses make a generator.

The code, however, when run, produces two identical lines:

Output
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
